# Yale Journal of Human Rights

### Yale University

The Yale Journal of Human Rights is looking for a student to build their website on Wordpress (also open to other platform suggestions). The site should function as a content management system with capabilities to display pictures, multimedia and text. A good example of what we had in mind was the Yale Record's site: yalerecord.org. We are willing to pay for this project. If interested, please contact arka.gupta@yale.edu for more
information.
